## Presentation details

- Register for NoDaLiDa: <https://www.nodalida2023.fo/registration>
- The registration includes workshop-only option and online registration.
- Please upload your materials (posters, slides, lighting talk slide) by clicking on the corresponding link. Links were distributed between presenters via e-mail.


### What type of presentation do you have?

#### If you are presenting a talk

  - Each talk can take up to **20 minutes** overall of which at least **5 minutes** are reserved for questions.
  - Before the talk upload your presentations slides to the on-site presentation computer. Workshop organisers who are there in person will help you with that.
  

#### If you are presenting a poster

  - You have 1 minute for a lightning talk to pitch your poster (see schedule). Please upload any slides for the lightning talk before May 21st. Read the e-mail sent out to presenters for instructions on uploading.
  - There will be poster boards that can fit posters of **A0** portrait size.
  - __5__ basic walls, posters can be placed on both sides (__10__).
  - __Where can I print the poster in Tórshavn?__
    - Føroya Prent shop: <https://foroyaprent.fo/> 
    - Write an email with your poster attached: <info@foroyaprent.fo>  
    - The shop is not in the city center and not immediately close to the venue, so plan accordingly.
    - For example, if you are taking an Airport Shuttle from the airport, you might be able to ask them to make a short stop on the way to your hotel/the workshop venue to pick up the poster.


### What mode of presentation do you have?

#### If you are presenting on-site

  - There will be a presentation computer linked to a room projector and Zoom.
  - This computer will have access to a shared folder where you can upload your presentation slides (pdf, and Powerpoint) beforehand.
  - Please let us know if you have any extra presentation requirements, e.g. playing videos or sound. 

#### If you are presenting online

  - The details for online participation (and where to uploade your slides beforehand) have been sent out by the NoDaLiDa organisers to the registered participants.
  - Please let us know if you have any extra presentation requirements, e.g. playing videos or sound. 
  - If you are presenting online, you can share your slides directly but you can still upload your files as a backup if something goes wrong (the link has been sent around).
