## Preliminaries

Make sure you have completed the following items:

1. Registration for either RESOURCEFUL-2025 only or NoDaLiDa + affiliated workshops. All authors of accepted papers received an email from OpenReview with information about registration discounts for both options, please check your spam folder if you cannot find this email. The registration is possible until February 23rd which is when general registration closes.
2. We ask all authors to upload their materials in order to ensure smooth organisation of the workshop (the link will be distributed via email soon). Depending on the type of your presentation, here is what we are asking you for:
   1. For **oral in-person** presentations:
      1. Upload slides of your talk.
   2. For **poster in-person** presentations:
      1. Upload the digital version of your poster.
   3. For **oral online** presentations:
      1. Upload slides of your talk.
   4. For **poster online** presentations:
      1. Submit a 3-5 minutes recorded video in which you describe your work. You are welcome to submit a digital version of your poster if you have any (it is optional).
      2. The videos (and posters, if available) will have to be uploaded to the link that will be provided soon.
      3. We will print QR codes and place them next to the list of virtual posters on the conference venue. Workshop participants then can scan and view videos if they want to.
