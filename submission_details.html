OpenReview submission link: **available soon**.

We invite submissions of both long (**8** pages) and short papers (**4** pages) with any number of pages for references.
All submissions must follow the NoDaLida template, available in both LaTeX and MS Word at the official conference website, [link](https://www.nodalida-bhlt2025.eu/call-for-papers#h.v2k63awq0fpe).
Submissions must be **anonymous** and submitted in the .pdf format through OpenReview.

We also invite submissions of maximum **2-page** extended **non-anonymous** abstracts with any number of pages for references describing work in progress, negative results and opinion pieces.
The abstracts, which should follow the same formatting templates as the archival track, will be considered by the workshop organisers and the accepted ones will be posted on the workshop website.

Papers of any length related to our theme and already published elsewhere will be considered for acceptance for presentation.
However, these will not be considered for publication in the proceedings.
